      <li>2 cups coconut juice </li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a steamer.
In a bowl, combine cassava, coconut juice, and sugar. Mix well until sugar is dissolved. Add lye water and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using food color and extracts, divide the mixture into three small bowls. Add a few drops of ube coloring in one bowl and pandan extract on the second bowl. Leave the third plain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let stand for about 30 minutes to one hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour into individual molds and arrange molds in a steamer. Steam for about 40 to 50 minutes or until translucent and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from steamer and refrigerate to about 20 to 30 minutes to completely cool and set. Remove from molds and roll in coconut to fully coat. If preferred, roll half of the batch in shredded cheese for variety.
